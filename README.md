The issue can be resolved using the method described here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1kgp7ar/cause_and_solution_to_windows_24h2_related/]. Therefore, the original purpose of creating this program has been perfectly addressed. However, you can still use this program to solve other efficiency mode-related issues.

Efficiency Mode Monitor is a simple tool that monitors specific application processes.
